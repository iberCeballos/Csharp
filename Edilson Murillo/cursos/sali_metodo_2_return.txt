Return
The basic way to return values from a method is to use a return statement! (A well-constructed programming language shouldn’t have a lot of surprises.)

Let’s start with an example in the below code. It contains a definition of the Yell() method, which returns a string, and it calls that method in Main().

When we execute this program, the code in Main() runs first:

Yell() is called.
In Yell(), the uppercase version of "who's there?" is created and returned.
Back in Main(), that returned value is stored in the variable output and then printed to the console:
static string Yell(string phrase) 
{
  return phrase.ToUpper();
}
 
public static void Main()
{
  string output = Yell("who's there?");
  Console.WriteLine(output); // Prints WHO'S THERE?
}
Here’s a more generic definition: the keyword return tells the computer to exit the method and return a value to wherever the method was called.

When a method is declared, it must announce the type of value it will return. In this case, Yell() returns a string, so it has the string modifier (right before the name Yell).

That first line of the method is called a method declaration, so we can say that the method declaration must contain the type of the return value.

Generally, the method declaration is a combination of details including: the access modifiers, return type, method name, and parameter types. This lesson will not cover access modifiers, like static, so that we can focus on the return type, like string.

Instructions
1.
Let’s define a static method DecoratePlanet() that takes a planet name as input and returns a fancy welcome to the planet.

First, write the method declaration. It should have a string parameter and return a string.

2.
Write the method body so that it returns a fancy welcome to the planet. For example, calling

DecoratePlanet("Mars");
returns:

"*.*.* Welcome to Mars *.*.*"

3.
Call the method with the argument "Jupiter" and print its output to the console.

using System;

namespace Return
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(DecoratePlanet("Jupiter"));    
    }
    
    static string DecoratePlanet(string planet)
    {
       return $"*..*..* Welcome to {planet} *..*..*";
    }
	}
}
